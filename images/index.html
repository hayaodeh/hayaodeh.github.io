        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>I'm a UI/UX Designer. Born in Abu Dhabi, raised in Jordan, I went to school to study Graphic Design &amp; Art.Through my school years I was deeply influenced by the impressionist movement in art. Thats when I started to pay attention of the crucial relation between design and the psyche, and that helped me in the way I approach my designs as a language or a way of communication.</p>

<p>After graduating, I spent a few years working at small design studios in Amman. meanwhile I paired with two programmers to do a side project, it was an open source and free app for helping people teach and learn programming online. And out of no where the project was a huge hit in the world of technology, which made me thrive for more and that passion found its new home in New York.</p>

<p>In this new challenge I started with freelancing with Graphic design but I wanted more as Iâ€™ve always had this thing for technology, thats when I decided to take a deep dive into the world of tech and I enrolled into the General Assembly UX Intensive course to study lean UX and have a change in career to emerge as a UI/UX designer</p>
